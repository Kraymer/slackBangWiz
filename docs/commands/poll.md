`!p <question> <emojis>` : post an emopoll

## Use
    
Ask a question with predefined possible answers.  
Because the emoreacts are posted by the bot, the original poster can vote too (which is not 
possible when  posting an  emopoll manually).
The _void_ emoji always close the emoreacts answers, marking the distinction with others random emojis that may be posted later.
